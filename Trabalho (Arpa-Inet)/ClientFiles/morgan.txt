Arthur Morgan is a character and the main playable protagonist of the video game Red Dead Redemption 2. 
A high-ranking member of the Van der Linde gang, Arthur must deal with the decline of the Wild West while 
attempting to survive against government forces and other adversaries in a fictionalized representation of 
the American frontier. He is portrayed by Roger Clark through performance capture.

Rockstar Games decided to focus Red Dead Redemption 2 on one character, in order to follow him more personally. 
They felt that this was more appropriate for the narrative structure of a Western. Clark wanted to play Arthur 
in a manner that was complex enough for the player to choose his path and still make sense. He took inspiration 
from actors such as Toshiro Mifune, John Wayne, and Rob Wiethoff, who played John Marston in the game and its 
predecessor.
